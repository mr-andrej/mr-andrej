## Presentation of my current situation

I'm a WebDev in training at [WildCodeSchool](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/fr-FR/campus/strasbourg). Here I aim to get my BAC+2 as a "Web and Mobile Applications Developer" before continuing my training further. I intend to continue my training and acquire a BAC+4 after this, specifically the title "Application Designer & Developer". After this second part of my professional training, I will continue to Epitech for a Masters in Cybersecurity (BAC+5) with the title of "Network and Security System Architect".

## Education

`2020-2022`
__WildCodeSchool Strasbourg__ First year consists learning web development with HTML/CSS/JS for front-end development and PHP for back-end devlopment. My second year will consist of even more challenges that I am yet to face. *WildCodeSchool* is a coding bootcamp that focuses on intense training through application of knowledge. We follow a full-time schedule of 9am to 5pm each working day.

`2017-2018`
__Epitech Strasbourg__ I was in Epitech for one year where I learned C. The first 5 weeks were done in a intense bootcamp environment, where students would spend 50-80h working in the building. After that the pace slowed down to a regular full-time workweek load of 30-40h.

## Hobbies
My main hobby is working out. I've built a small gym on my balcony that I use to follow a not-so-strict weight training regiment. Before the planet was infested with COVID-19, I partook heavily in Krav-Maga/MMA, running, and weight training with a focus on strength. Now most of my free time is occupied with playing video games, if I'm not researching anything for either my work or training. Though if I was to rank my current hobbies in order of preference, it would go like:
* Video Games (RS 2: Vietnam / EFT / KF: 2)
* Weightlifting
* Rowing (on a machine)
